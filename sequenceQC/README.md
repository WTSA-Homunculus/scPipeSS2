# sequenceQC - A pipeline for short read sequencing quality control

This repository contains a snakemake pipeline design to chain together a set of common tasks in quality control of
sequencing data generated by short-read (i.e. Illumina) high-throughput sequencers.

The princiapl tasks are:

* Remove library primers and sequencing adaptors (these can severly affect the quality of read alignment and
  other downstream tasks)
* Run fastQC, a program design to assess the overall quality of sequencing, such as base calling, sequence composition,
  and adaptor contamination.

This pipeline is, by design, generic to any experiment using Illumina sequencing, and is not specific to say, RNA-seq or
ChIP-seq.
